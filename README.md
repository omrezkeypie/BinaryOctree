# About

BinaryOctree is an optimized octree that is both memory effiecent and cpu effiecent. 

**Note** The module has no update function for dynamic objects as the updating was slower than just recreating a new octree per frame.

# Performance

**All the benchmarks shown use 1000 objects**

# API

```lua
BinaryOctreeModule.new(Size : number, MaxDepth : number?,OffsetPosition : Vector3?) : HashOctree
```

Takes in a number for the size of the octree and an optional max subdivision depth (The top limit is 10 depth) and an optional OffsetPosition and returns the octree.

```lua
BinaryOctreeModule.InsertObjects(HashOctree : HashOctree,Objects : {Object})
```

Takes in a table of objects (anything with a Position value) and inserts them into the octree.

```lua
BinaryOctreeModule.RemoveObject(HashOctree : HashOctree,Object : Object)
```

Takes in an object and removes it from the octree.

```lua
BinaryOctreeModule.InsertObject(HashOctree : HashOctree,Object : Object)
```

Takes in an object and inserts it into the octree.

```lua
BinaryOctreeModule.QueryBox(HashOctree : HashOctree,Position : Vector3,Size : Vector3) : {Object}
```

Takes in the box's position and size and returns all the objects in the octree inside said box.

```lua
BinaryOctreeModule.QuerySphere(HashOctree : HashOctree,Position : Vector3,Radius : number) : {Object}
```

Takes in the sphere's position and radius and returns all the objects in the octree inside said sphere.

```lua
BinaryOctreeModule.VisualizeOctree(HashOctree : HashOctree)
```

Takes in an octree and visualizes it.
